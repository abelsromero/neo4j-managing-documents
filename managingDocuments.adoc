= Modeling and analyzing a content repository

:toc: macro

We deal with documents every day, sometimes in some ways we are not aware of.
The idea of sharing ideas in a persistent support has been one the first facts that made the human kind what is it.
From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Altamira[Altamira's paintings] in Spain to modern https://www.wikipedia.org/[Wikipedia] documents are anything that enables sharing knowledge.

So, we shouldn't be afraid to assume that we are familiar with them and we know how to deal with them;
" it is just a few words and images in a linear structure. Once it's finished, just press Save and Send them".

Well, this is not true and this article talks about the complexity about dealing with groups of documents (especially in digital system).
In this article you will find an example model to help analyze document's repositories and some examples of which kind of data can be extracted.

== What is a document?

Pretty much everyone has an idea of what a document is. Depending on their daily activities, different people may describe them as:

* A piece of paper with some text.
* That filled form I had to provide to get my taxes back.
* An article on Wikipedia, a blog post, _Â¿does a twit count as a document, isn't it too shot?_
* My college degree.
* Simple, a _Word_ file.

Pretty much all of them hit it and we all can recognize a document when put in front of us.
But a document is something far more complex and that.

To begin with, a document is not only the content itself, but it includes metadata, for instance, the name of the file on the filesystem or the URL pointing to it.

.Metadata is also part of a document
image::{images-url}metadata.png[]

Just with some quick though one may find several way to classify documents depending on many characteristics:

. Is it self-contained or links other elements?
. Does the document have more than one version?
. In what format is it stored (MS Word, plain text, PNG, etc.)? Can it be transformed into other formats?.footnote:[This transformation process is usually also refered as renderitzations]
. What kind of metadata is included?
. Is it a structured like an XML or is it free format? footnote:[Obviously all document formats have a formal structure but this case is from the final presentation point of view] and so on.

That's only focusing on features involved in the constructions, presentation and basic storage of a document.
If you enter into other aspects provided by content management tools like security, preservation, multi-language support, etc. this becomes complex to the headache degree.
For the sake of this analysis we have define the following simple model:

image::{images-url}model.png[]

_For simplicity let's assume that the document entity is an aggregation of the different versions a document._
_This means, that the `INCLUDE` relationship is just a dependency relationship._
_We are not discussing here different types of inclusion or if a document may include some specific version. However, we will talk about that later._

== Let's play with the data

=== The data set
To test the model here is some data. To avoid looking into the data, this model represents the next scenario.

We have 6 documents:

. A book: it has 2 versions (_Draft_ and _Final_) each one with its own metadata, and original content.
However, only the 2nd version generates an output, in PDF format.
. A possible User manual inspired by GitHub README's. This manual has 3 versions and in the third one a _Contributor's guide_ was includes.
Also, until the 3rd version, the manual was only published as HTML, from that version, PDF was added to the pipeline.
. _Contributor's guide_ included by the 2nd document.
This document does not have any versions and can only be viewed as an stand-alone HTML.
. _User Manual_ also included by the 2nd document.
Similar to the previous one, it can be viewed as HTML and is included in the README.
. _Code examples_ that are used in the _User Manual_.
This document provides a small hint of how deep those include relationships can become.
. _Offline User manual_.
This is a special document, because it only links to the User Manual and it's purpose is to provide with a nice PDF to see offline.
Since it is not mean to be accessible on the site, it does not include the _Contributor's guide_.

=== Analyzing the data set

Imagine you are responsible for keeping a repository like the one presented.
Certainly you'll want to obtain some statistic regarding the documents in order to optimize some tasks and overall, help managing the repository.

To begin, here are some simple examples.

* *Obtaining number of outputs*

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (v)-[:GENERATES]->(n)
RETURN n.name AS Output ,count(n) as Count
----

//table

This allows you to plan your generations pipelines to see, for instance, what can be run in parallel, or what kind of output may require more resources.

* *Seeing document dependencies*

This will help you to detect any possible bottle necks.
Not only for output generation, but it provides with graphical representation of highly used documents.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (document:Document)-[:INCLUDES]->(included_document)
RETURN document, included_document
----

//graph_result

For instance, if you have a document included by let's say 50 other documents, it would be a good idea to implement caching methods to avoid the cost of retrieving it any time.

Of course, this depends on what kind of system yo use to store them.

[TIP]
====
Even when using VCSs it's not a good idea to have documents that is used by lots of others.
Like in software, this is a form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)[coupling] and may cause many issue, for instance merge conflicts.

Consider clearly stating for each document its purpose and content.
====

* *Visualizing output per document*

As the repository grows, at some point you will need to review what kind of outputs are required for each final document.

Chances are that some outputs may not be needed or maybe some output format needs to be replaced.
For those cases the following query provides for each document what output produces.

[source,cypher]
----
Match (d:Document)-[h]-(v:Version)-[r]->(o:Output) return DISTINCT (d.name),o.name
----

//table

The aim of this report is to be able to estimate (qualitatively at least) the effort to act on some output.
For instance, if you have to migrate from PDF to epub it will be necessary to review and test that all content is correctly generated.

Those use cases are based on personal experiences but remember...the sky is the limit in what kind of information you can obtain from a this or other models.


== Final notes
To end this, just a few words on why using a graph database offers advantages on this kind of analysis.

Certainly the example model is not too complex but, it could be argued that with little effort it could be build on top of a relational database.
But please, keep in mind that this is a simplification.

A real model becomes much more complex and specially interconnected (includes, versions, etc.). Not only that, a real model should take into consideration that:

. Metadata is dynamic, with different sets of documents having different sets of properties. PDF may need to store the compliance version for instance.
. The number of dependency relationships amongst documents can be typed and very varied. Inclusion is an example, but how about links? quotations? references? Each one of them requires different treatments and here is where a graph database shines.
. The number of dependencies can become extremely high. Think of the Wikipedia as an example, trying to model that amount of relationships would require some extra work to efficiently deal with them in a conventional database.
. Versions and outputs are documents on its own right. That is that a real model should consider them as subclasses of Document, making many relations recursive.

I hope this serves to provide an insight of how to model a content repository in a graph database and why it becomes a useful tool to do so.
